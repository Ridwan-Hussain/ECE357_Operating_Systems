Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread 
every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming 
laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running 
idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at 
the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his 
desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an 
outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer’s thigh. I start 
shaking. I keep telling myself I’m going to be alright and that 
there’s nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. 
Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family
saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student 
turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard 
flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears 
and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The 
classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere 
seconds my world has gone from vibrant life to a dark, earth-
shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph 
gale force winds and the 500-decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my
body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. 
I hate gaming laptops.

*jaw drops to floor, eyes pop out of sockets accompanied by trumpets,
heart beats out of chest, awooga awooga sound effect, pulls chain on 
train whistle that has appeared next to head as steam blows out, 
slams fists on table, rattling any plates, bowls or silverware, 
whistles loudly, fireworks shoot from top of head, pants loudly as 
tongue hangs out of mouth, wipes comically large bead of sweat from 
forehead, clears throat, straightens tie, combs hair* Ahem, you look 
very lovely.

Jeff Bezos has 121 BILLION dollars. The population of earth is 7 
billion people. He could give every person 1 BILLION dollars and end 
poverty, and he would still have 114 billion dollars left over but he
wouldn't do it. This is what capitalist greed looks like!

On the 😳outside 😂I skrrt😤💯 skrrt 
🅱️ut ☝️😳on the inside 🥺I hurt 😔😥hurt 😥💦.

I must give you my greatest apology. I never meant it to go this far.
When I started these shenanigans, I imagined nothing of such a 
serious matter. I didn’t mean to harm your dignity, respect, or 
honor. But, now that’s it’s gone this far, I can only do one thing; 
apologize. So, from the bottom of my intellect, family, pride, and 
dogs, I give you my strongest and hardiest apology. I hope you could 
forgive me one day.

A rubber room with rats. And rats make me crazy.
