# Program Requirements
- [ ] Given a name of an existing file and a starting pathname, find the locations of ALL of the identical files to the given file
    - [ ] Two files are identical is they share the same content byte wise
    - [ ] Metadata does not impact if two files ar identical
- [ ] Should only look at Regular Files and Symlinks
- [ ] If a file is found, print to standard output:
    - [ ] pathname of the matching file
        - [ ] Absolute pathname = absolute pathname, relative pathname = relative pathname
    - [ ] if link count > 1 AND there's a hard link, output this
    - [ ] Otherwise, if they have the same contents, output the nlink of the matching file
    - [ ] If you encounter a symlink:
        - [ ] "symlink resolves to original target file inode, report this" (?)
        - [ ] symlink resolves to distinct inode which is identical to the content of the given file
            - [ ] report this 
            - [ ] report contents of symlink
        - [ ] DO NOT FOLLOW SYMLINKS TO AVOID LOOPS
- [ ] Distinguishing between critical and non-critical errors
    - [ ] Can't open given file ==> Critical
    - [ ] Can't open directory ==> Non-critical
    - [ ] Report all errors to stderror with the 4 basic information from Unit 1
        - [ ] Info #1
        - [ ] Info #2
        - [ ] Info #3
        - [ ] Info #4
- [ ] Be as efficient, skip reading file contents when possible
- [ ] Should work on binary files
- [ ] Useful commands: opendir, readdir, closedir, fprintf, strlen
- [ ] See problem set for useful output
